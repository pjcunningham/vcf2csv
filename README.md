## ðŸ¤– Built With Help From ChatGPT

This project was created in collaboration with [ChatGPT Python GPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt), a customized AI assistant for advanced Python development.

*Special thanks to GPT for helping transform a messy vCard export into a clean, production-grade command-line tool.*

## Building a Standalone Executable

You can build a standalone executable using the included `build.py` script, which uses Nuitka to compile the Python code:

```
python build.py
```

This will create a self-contained executable in the project root directory. The executable includes all dependencies and can be distributed without requiring Python or any additional packages to be installed.

Requirements for building:
* Python 3.9+
* Nuitka (installed automatically via project dependencies)
* A C compiler (MinGW64 on Windows, which Nuitka can download automatically)
